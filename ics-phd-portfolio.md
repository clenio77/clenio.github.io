# ICS Ph.D. Portfolio Guidelines

The [ICS Ph.D. degree program](http://www.ics.hawaii.edu/academics/graduate-degree-programs/ph-d-in-ics/) requires the development of a portfolio containing a statement of purpose, evidence of core competency, evidence of scholarly ability, and other evidence of professional capacity.

One way to satisfy these requirements is by the creation of a TechFolio with a structure that provides an appropriate public professional portfolio for a Ph.D. student while also satisfying the requirements for the ICS portfolio review process.   Here is one way to do it:

**CV**. In \_config.yml, change bio-page-label to "CV", and set the theme-bio parameter to "theme-bio-builtin-2".  You may want to make additional customizations to this theme file (\_includes/theme-bio-builtin-2.html) to best present your background as you documented it in \_data/bio.json.  Note that degrees, publications, and jobs should be listed in reverse chronological order.
   
**Projects.** Create a TechFolio project to describe each of your major projects (finished or in-progress) as an undergraduate, professional, and graduate student. When appropriate, these project pages should link to a GitHub (or other cloud-based) repository where code and other artifacts can be reviewed.

**Essays.**  Create four essays: statement-of-purpose.md, evidence-of-core-competency.md, evidence-of-scholarly-ability.md, and other-evidence-of-professional-capacity.md.  These essays should satisfy the requirements in the degree program guidelines. They can include links to PDF files of publications and other scholarly writings (such as the literature review), as well as links to your project pages. 
   
Note that you can also use the Essay feature to document your literature review (and any other long-form publications).  For example, create your publication as a PDF file, then put it in a top-level directory called (for example) pubs/.   Then create an essay (for example, machine-learning-literature-review.md) which includes only the abstract of your lit review (or publication) along with a link to the full PDF. If you do take this route, you might want to change the label on the home page from "Essays" to something more general, such as "Writings".
